# Instructions for AI Coding Agents

**Utilities** is a C# .NET library of general-purpose utility classes, published as the NuGet package `InsaneGenius.Utilities` and consumed directly from `main`. The library ships under [`Utilities/`](./Utilities/), with a `Sandbox/` console app for experimentation and an xUnit test project (`UtilitiesTests/`).

This file is the canonical reference for cross-cutting AI-agent rules. The CI/CD workflow contract and conventions live in [`WORKFLOW.md`](./WORKFLOW.md); C# code-style conventions live in [`CODESTYLE.md`](./CODESTYLE.md). Copilot review *mechanics* are owned by [`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](./.github/copilot-instructions.md) - this file delegates them there explicitly (see "PR Review Etiquette" below). High-level summaries in other docs (e.g. README's Contributing section) are allowed when they link back here; don't duplicate the rules themselves. The library's **project-specific conventions and public-API/behavioral contracts** also live here (the [Library API Conventions](#library-api-conventions) section), **not** in `.github/copilot-instructions.md` - that file targets GitHub Copilot / VS Code specifically, while this file is the agent-agnostic one every coding agent reads, so any rule a reviewer must honor has to live here to be provider-independent.

**Where rules live.** A durable project, code, or style rule belongs in this file (or `WORKFLOW.md` / `CODESTYLE.md` as appropriate), so it is versioned and read by every session and every agent. An agent's own session memory or scratch state is private and lost on restart, so it is never the system of record for a rule: when you learn or are corrected on a rule, write it into the right doc in the same change. Memory may also note it, but the committed docs are the source of truth.

## Git and Commit Rules

- **Default to staging, not committing.** Stage changes with `git add` and leave `git commit` to the developer unless the developer has explicitly authorized the agent to commit for the current ask ("commit this", "open a PR", etc.). Authorization is scope-bound - it covers the commits needed for that specific task, not a blanket commit license for the rest of the session.
- **All commits must be cryptographically signed (SSH or GPG).** Branch protection enforces this on both branches; unsigned commits are rejected on push. Signing depends on environment configuration - `git config commit.gpgsign true`, a configured `user.signingkey`, and a working signing agent (loaded `ssh-agent` for SSH, or `gpg-agent` for GPG). If signing is not configured in the environment, **do not commit** - surface the missing config to the developer and stop at `git add`. Verify before any agent-authored commit (`git config --get commit.gpgsign && ssh-add -L` or the GPG equivalent). **Signing must be live before the *first* commit, not retrofitted.** Turning on `Require signed commits` against a branch that already has unsigned commits forces a rewrite of that entire history to re-sign it - changing every commit SHA and making whoever does the rewrite the committer and signer of every commit (a rebase preserves the `author` field but not the original signatures; you cannot sign another contributor's commits for them). During new-repo setup, never create commits until signing is verified.
- **Never force push.** Do not run `git push --force` or `git push --force-with-lease` under any circumstances. Force pushing rewrites shared history and can cause data loss.
- **Never run destructive git commands** (`git reset --hard`, `git checkout .`, `git restore .`, `git clean -f`) without explicit developer instruction.

## Branching Model

This is the developer-facing git policy. The branch rulesets that enforce it (merge methods, required check, strict-status settings, and the reasons), and the merge-bot workflow behavior, are specified in [`WORKFLOW.md`](./WORKFLOW.md) (rulesets in section 6, bots in D8) and codified in [`repo-config/`](./repo-config/). Do not restate them here.

- `develop` is the integration branch. Feature branches merge to `develop` **squash-only**, keeping develop linear. `develop` merges to `main` **merge-commit only** (no squash, no rebase), so `main` keeps a real reference to the develop commits a release came from.
- **`develop` is forward-only**: no `main -> develop` back-merges. Historical back-merge commits in `git log` predate this rule and must not be repeated.
- All commits on both branches are cryptographically signed (see Git and Commit Rules). Squash and merge commits created in the GitHub UI are signed by GitHub's web-flow key.
- **Bots target both `main` and `develop` directly.** Dependabot opens PRs against each branch independently. This is deliberate: running a bot on one branch and merging its changes across to the other causes endless conflicts as the feature -> develop -> main flow moves underneath it, whereas landing the same dependency update directly in each branch keeps bot changes conflict-free regardless of what else is in flight, and keeps the `main` package fresh without waiting on a promotion. Dependabot security PRs open against `main`. The mechanics (Dependabot's per-target-branch config) are in [`WORKFLOW.md`](./WORKFLOW.md) D8.

## Release Model

The release and publish behavior - branch-scoped versioning (`main` = stable, `develop` = prerelease), the self-sufficient publish model (each shipped change auto-publishes; a maintainer dispatches to force a release), the pull-request smoke gate, and Dependabot auto-merge - is specified in [`WORKFLOW.md`](./WORKFLOW.md), the canonical CI/CD guide. Do not duplicate those rules here.

Versioning is the one release rule that is a **human process**, not a workflow outcome, so it lives here ([`WORKFLOW.md`](./WORKFLOW.md) D3.3 defers to this):

- The `version` (major.minor) in [`version.json`](./version.json) is the version floor; NBGV appends the git height (the SemVer patch position). `main` builds a stable `X.Y.<height>`; `develop` builds a prerelease `X.Y.<height>-g<sha>`. The maintainer edits `version.json`; *routine* dependency bumps, CI/workflow fixes, and doc edits leave it untouched.
- **Bump `version.json` only by maintainer instruction**, for a functional change (a new feature, a behavior or API change, a breaking change) or a significant one-time overhaul of the build/release process (such as a CI/CD migration), in the PR that introduces it (typically on `develop`). Do not bump on a fixed cadence, for routine CI/workflow or dependency or doc edits, or mechanically after a release.
- **No post-release bump; no develop-ahead requirement.** NBGV advances the patch (git height) on every commit, so a release always gets a fresh build version with no `version.json` edit and there is no `bump-version-X.Y` PR after a release. A `develop -> main` promotion carries whatever `version.json` is current: a promotion with a functional bump releases that new version on `main`; a maintenance-only promotion (dependency bumps, CI/doc fixes) carries the unchanged `version.json` and `main` advances only its NBGV height.

## Pull Request Title and Commit Message Conventions

### Format

- Imperative subject summarizing the change, <=72 characters, no trailing period. ("Add 24-hour PM2.5 average sensor", not "Added X" or "Adds X".)
- Optional body, blank-line separated, explaining *why* the change is being made when that's non-obvious. The diff shows *what*.

### Rules

- Don't write `update stuff`, `wip`, or other vague titles. (Dependabot's default `Bump X from Y to Z` titles are fine - keep them.)
- Don't add `Co-Authored-By:` lines unless the developer explicitly asks.
- Don't put release-bump magnitude in the title - no "minor", "patch", "release v0.2.0", etc. Nerdbank.GitVersioning computes the next release version from `version.json` + git history. Dependency versions in dependency-bump titles are fine and expected.
- Use US English spelling and match the existing heading style of the file you're editing: title case with lowercase short bind words (a, an, the, and, but, or, of, in, on, at, to, by, for, from); hyphenated compounds capitalize both parts unless the second is a short preposition (*Built-in*, *EPA-Corrected*, *24-Hour*).

### Examples

```text
Add structured logging extensions to library
Pin softprops/action-gh-release to commit SHA
Drop ProcessEx wrapper in favor of CliWrap
Bump xunit.v3 from 3.2.2 to 3.3.0
Clarify release model in README
```

## Documentation Style Conventions

### Characters and voice

- **No em-dashes (`U+2014`), ever.** They are the clearest tell of machine-written prose and are not how this repo is written. Use a spaced hyphen ` - `, a comma, a colon, parentheses, or two sentences instead. Avoid the matching tell of long semicolon-chained sentences. Prefer plain, short sentences.
- **Default to ASCII.** Non-ASCII is allowed only where the character carries real visual or semantic meaning ASCII cannot - a warning or info icon in a README callout, or a unit symbol (ohm, micro, degree). Never use non-ASCII decoratively: no fancy quotes, no Unicode arrows (write `->`), no ellipsis character (write `...`), no en-dash (write `-`).
- Spell in US English, not UK English (see the PR-title rules).

### Markdown

- Use reference-style links for any URL referenced more than once or appearing in lists; alphabetize the reference definitions block.
- Inline single-use relative links (e.g. `[CODESTYLE.md](./CODESTYLE.md)`) are fine.
- One logical paragraph per line; no hard-wrap line-length limit. For an intentional hard line break within a block - stacked badges, status, or license lines - end the line with a trailing backslash (`\`); this explicit form is preferred over trailing whitespace and is not treated as a paragraph split.
- Headings follow the title-case-with-short-bind-words rule from the PR-title section.
- **Write docs in the current state, not as a change from a prior one.** The reader has no memory of the previous behavior, so describe what *is*: "X does Y", never "X *now* does Y", "X *no longer* does Z", or "changed/switched/restored to Y". Before/after framing belongs in changelogs, commit messages, and PR descriptions - not in `README.md` or other living docs.

### Comments

Applies to code and workflow (`#`) comments alike.

- Comment only when the code is non-obvious or important. Self-evident code needs no comment.
- Judge "obvious" in context, not line by line. A note that reads as redundant on its own line can be essential in the larger flow - a comment marking a workflow step's exit condition, for example, even though the line itself plainly does a `return` or `exit`.
- State the non-obvious *why*, not what the code already shows. No cross-project references (do not name other repos), no historic or design narrative, no rule citations - governance lives in this file, not echoed inline.
- **One line if it fits in ~120 columns.** Do not wrap a comment at 75-80 columns; a short two-line comment that would fit on one line looks sloppy - collapse it. Go multi-line only when the content genuinely exceeds ~120, filling each line rather than narrow-wrapping. For a multi-point comment, prefer short structured lines or `-` bullets over one prose paragraph.
- **Workflows: prefer one short summary description at the top of the file** over scattering rationale across steps; comment an individual step only when its purpose is non-obvious.
- **Do not accumulate comments.** When you change code or a comment, rewrite the whole comment fresh; never bolt a new comment onto an existing one or layer explanations across edits. Comment volume should stay flat or shrink over time, not grow.
- **Leave human-authored comments and emojis exactly as written** - do not reword, trim, reflow, or "clean" them, even if they seem to bend a rule. Revise only agent-authored comments, and match the surrounding voice when you do.

### Line Endings

- [`.editorconfig`](./.editorconfig) defines the correct ending per file type (CRLF for `.md`, `.cs`, XML/`.csproj`/`.props`, `.yml`/`.yaml`, `.json`, `.cmd`/`.bat`/`.ps1`; LF for `.sh`), and [`.gitattributes`](./.gitattributes) (`* -text`) stops git from normalizing.
- **Editing an existing file: preserve its current line endings** - do not reflow them as a side effect of a content change, even if the file is already non-compliant. After any programmatic edit, verify with `git diff --stat` (only changed lines) and `file <path>` (expected ending). Bring a non-compliant file to its `.editorconfig` ending only as a deliberate, isolated EOL-only change.

### Quantitative Claims

- Any quantitative claim in `README.md` (counts, sizes, version floors, supported platforms) must be verified against current code. If a doc number is derived from a code constant, mark the dependency in a source-code comment so the next editor knows to update both.

## PR Review Etiquette

> This "PR Review Etiquette" section is the provider-agnostic review-loop *contract*; the [`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](./.github/copilot-instructions.md) "GitHub Copilot Review Runbook" implements its mechanics. Without both, an agent has no pointer to the reliable Copilot mechanics and falls back to ad-hoc (and known-broken) behavior.

The repo runs a review loop on every PR: local agent iteration plus remote automated review (GitHub Copilot is the configured reviewer). Treat this as a contract regardless of which local agent authored the changes.

### Merge Gate (read this first)

**Do not merge - and do not enable auto-merge - unless ALL of these hold:**

1. Required status checks are green (`mergeStateStatus: CLEAN`), **and**
2. A Copilot review is confirmed on the **current head SHA** (not an earlier push), **and**
3. **Every** Copilot finding on that head SHA is closed out - all review threads resolved, **and** any issue-level Copilot comments (which have no resolve action) triaged and replied to - so zero outstanding findings remain, **and**
4. The maintainer has given **explicit** permission to merge.

`mergeStateStatus: CLEAN` reflects **only** required statuses - it never reflects open bot review comments, so `CLEAN` alone is **never** sufficient to merge. A green/`CLEAN` PR with an unresolved Copilot finding fails this gate; treat it as "not mergeable" no matter what the merge-state field says. The agent never merges on its own (consistent with "default to staging"; merging is maintainer-authorized).

**Merging a shipped change releases.** A merge to `main` or `develop` that changes a shipped input - including a dependency bump (`Directory.Packages.props`), so the published package's dependencies stay current - auto-publishes that branch (see [`WORKFLOW.md`](./WORKFLOW.md)); a merge confined to tests, tooling, docs, CI, or GitHub-Actions bumps does not. Releasing is a configured consequence of merging a shipped change, so weigh the release impact before merging to `main`. Never manually force a publish (`workflow_dispatch`) without explicit maintainer instruction.

### Expected Review Loop

1. Push changes to the PR branch.
2. Re-request a review for the **current head SHA**. Auto-trigger is unreliable, so request it explicitly via the `requestReviews` GraphQL mutation (now reliable end-to-end - see the runbook); the UI is only a fallback.
3. Wait for review activity on that head. A completed review that raises **no findings** is a valid terminal outcome for that head - proceed; do not re-trigger it or treat the absence of comments as a missing review.
4. Triage findings.
5. Apply fixes or write a rationale for declines.
6. Reply to each thread and resolve what was addressed.
7. Re-run the loop after every fix push until no actionable findings remain.

Drive the loop to green - review confirmed on the latest head SHA and every actionable finding closed - then stop and apply the **Merge Gate** above: all four preconditions must hold, and `mergeStateStatus: CLEAN` alone never satisfies it.

For provider-specific mechanics (how to request review, query review state, post replies, resolve threads), see the **GitHub Copilot Review Runbook** in [.github/copilot-instructions.md](./.github/copilot-instructions.md). This file owns the contract; that file owns the mechanics.

### Triaging Review Comments

For each comment, classify before responding:

- **Bug** - wrong behavior, missing test coverage, or a real divergence between code and docs. Fix it. Reply with the fixing commit SHA when done.
- **Style/convention** - the comment cites a rule from this file or a language-specific style guide. Two cases:
  - The cited rule matches what the existing codebase already does -> fix the offending code.
  - The cited rule contradicts what's in the tree, or industry norm -> **update the rule instead of the code**. The rule is wrong, not the code. Bouncing the same code across rounds is the symptom of a wrong rule. Heuristic: three rounds on the same style category means the rule needs adjusting and the user should authorize the rule change.
- **Architectural opinion** - the comment proposes a different design ("constrain this to disabled-by-default", "move it elsewhere", "add a runtime guardrail"). This is judgment, not a bug. Surface it to the user with a recommendation; don't apply unilaterally.

### Responding and Resolution Expectations

Reply inline with either the fixing commit SHA (for accepted issues) or a concise rationale (for declines). Resolve review threads when addressed or intentionally declined with rationale. Issue-level comments (those at `repos/.../issues/<N>/comments` rather than tied to a specific line) have no resolution action - acknowledge with a reply if needed and move on.

After the final push on a PR, sweep older threads from earlier rounds whose code paths no longer exist; otherwise stale unresolved markers remain in the review UI.

### Escalating to the User

Bring the user in when:

- **Genuine design trade-off** surfaces (fail-open vs fail-closed, narrow vs broad refactor scope, "should we add a guardrail or trust the doc comment"). Triage, recommend, ask.
- **Repeated friction** across rounds without convergence - that's the rule-needs-updating signal. Stop, summarize the pattern, and let the user authorize the rule change.
- **Architectural redesign** is requested rather than a bug fix. Surface with a recommendation; never apply unilaterally.

Anti-pattern: don't keep flipping the code on the same style point. Flip the rule once and stick to the rule.

## Shared Configuration and Tooling

- **Config files.** [`.editorconfig`](./.editorconfig) (per-file-type EOL plus the C# / ReSharper style block), [`.gitattributes`](./.gitattributes), [`.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc`](./.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc), [`CODESTYLE.md`](./CODESTYLE.md) (C# code style), and [`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](./.github/copilot-instructions.md) (the Copilot review runbook) hold the repo's formatting, linting, and review-mechanics rules. `CODESTYLE.md` sits at the repo root because `AGENTS.md` and `copilot-instructions.md` link it by relative path. Keep `copilot-instructions.md` narrow (Copilot/VS Code mechanics plus the commit/PR-title summary); project-specific conventions and the public-API contract live in this file, not there.
- **Clean-compile gate.** Husky.Net pre-commit git hooks run the C# clean-compile checks (CSharpier format, then `dotnet format style --verify-no-changes`), installed with `dotnet tool restore` + `dotnet husky install`. The [`.vscode/tasks.json`](./.vscode/tasks.json) tasks `.NET Build`, `CSharpier Format`, and `.NET Format` are the canonical task names (owned by the `CODESTYLE.md` ".NET" section); do not loosen them. CI is the authoritative backstop: the `lint` job ([`WORKFLOW.md`](./WORKFLOW.md) D1.3) enforces CSharpier, `dotnet format style`, `markdownlint`, scoped `cspell`, and `actionlint` from the same config files, because a local hook can be bypassed. Keep the editor task, the hook, and CI in sync (CODESTYLE "Clean-Compile Verification").
- **Linting tools.** CI is the authoritative lint run; a local run is only for fast feedback. The `dotnet` checks need only the .NET SDK: `dotnet format style` is built into the SDK, and CSharpier is restored by `dotnet tool restore` against [`.config/dotnet-tools.json`](./.config/dotnet-tools.json). The markdown, spelling, and workflow linters have no committed manifest; run each from its official Docker image, the portable path that avoids a local Node or Go install, mounting the repo as the working directory: `cspell` from `ghcr.io/streetsidesoftware/cspell`, `markdownlint-cli2` from `davidanson/markdownlint-cli2`, and `actionlint` (which bundles `shellcheck`) from `rhysd/actionlint`, pinned to the versions [`validate-task.yml`](./.github/workflows/validate-task.yml) uses. Each takes the file globs directly, for example `docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/work -w /work ghcr.io/streetsidesoftware/cspell cspell README.md HISTORY.md` or `... davidanson/markdownlint-cli2 '**/*.md'`. The cspell accepted-word list and the path exclusions both live in [`cspell.json`](./cspell.json), the single source: the Code Spell Checker extension reads `cspell.json` ahead of the workspace `cSpell` settings (so GUI "Add to dictionary" lands words there), and the CLI and CI read the same file. Do not keep a parallel word list in the `.code-workspace` file. A local cspell or markdownlint result that reports zero files checked scanned nothing; ignore it. There is intentionally no wrapper script; the editor, these Docker images, and CI are the supported runners.
- **Release notes.** Keep a short summary in [`README.md`](./README.md) and the full history in [`HISTORY.md`](./HISTORY.md); update both when cutting a release.

## Workflow YAML Conventions

The conventions for everything under `.github/workflows/` - action pinning, file/workflow/job/step naming, concurrency, shells, conditionals, boolean inputs, permissions, artifact handoff and cleanup, and release tagging - are specified in [`WORKFLOW.md`](./WORKFLOW.md) (sections 2 and 4), the canonical guide for this repo's CI/CD. New and modified workflows must respect it. Do not duplicate those rules here; this section is a pointer.

## Automating Workflow Validation

[`WORKFLOW.md`](./WORKFLOW.md) is a machine-followable rulebook, not just documentation: it defines a static audit (5A), end-to-end trace scenarios (5B), a live probe (5C), and a repository-configuration audit (5D) that together yield a binary **operational / not-operational** verdict. When asked to check, change, or troubleshoot the CI/CD workflows, **drive that methodology** - audit the workflow files and repository configuration against the section-4 contract, trace the affected scenarios, and report the verdict with `file:line` citations - rather than reasoning about the YAML ad hoc. A workflow change is not done until it has been re-validated this way (probe without publishing).

## Project Structure

- **Utilities** (`Utilities/Utilities.csproj`)
  - Core library project, published as NuGet `InsaneGenius.Utilities`. Target framework: .NET 10.0.
- **Sandbox** (`Sandbox/Sandbox.csproj`)
  - Console app for experimentation; not packaged or published.
- **UtilitiesTests** (`UtilitiesTests/UtilitiesTests.csproj`)
  - xUnit test suite.
- **Build configuration**:
  - Common MSBuild properties (`TargetFramework`, `Nullable`, `AnalysisLevel`, etc.) live in `Directory.Build.props` at the solution root. Do not duplicate these in individual `.csproj` files - only add a property to a `.csproj` when it is project-specific or overrides the shared default.
  - All NuGet package versions are centralized in `Directory.Packages.props`. `PackageReference` elements in `.csproj` files must not include a `Version` attribute. Asset metadata (`PrivateAssets`, `IncludeAssets`) stays in the `.csproj` `PackageReference` element.
  - **Brownfield analyzer relaxations.** `Directory.Build.props` sets strict `AnalysisLevel latest-all` / `AnalysisMode All` / `TreatWarningsAsErrors`. Because this is a pre-existing library, a specific set of analyzer rules that would otherwise break the build or force a public-API break are relaxed to suggestion in [`.editorconfig`](./.editorconfig); each is documented inline. Prefer fixing new violations over adding relaxations.
- **Style guide**: [`CODESTYLE.md`](./CODESTYLE.md) for C# code conventions; [`.github/copilot-instructions.md`](./.github/copilot-instructions.md) for the Copilot review runbook.

## Library API Conventions

Project-specific public-API conventions for the library (these are behavioral contracts, so they live here rather than in `CODESTYLE.md`):

- **I/O methods return `bool`** for success/failure; additional outputs use `out` parameters.
- **Async methods carry the `Async` suffix** and an optional `CancellationToken cancellationToken = default`, passed through to the underlying call.
- **`Download`** reuses a thread-safe `Lazy<HttpClient>` and uses `HttpCompletionOption.ResponseHeadersRead`; async overloads return tuples for multiple values.
- **`FileEx`** wraps I/O in retry logic configured via `Options`, with cancellation via `Options.Cancel` and the method parameter.
- **`StringCompression`** uses Deflate, supports configurable compression levels, and passes `leaveOpen` so the caller retains stream ownership.
- **`Extensions`** uses the C# `extension` syntax (inside a static class) for logger and string helpers.
